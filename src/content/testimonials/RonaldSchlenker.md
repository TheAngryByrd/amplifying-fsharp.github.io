"Jedem Anfang wohnt ein Zauber inne" (Hermann Hesse; Stufen)
===

There was it: The moment when the knot bursts. I knew now: I got it solved, and the problem I stared on for a long time looked so simple now. As we all must meet our moment of truth one day, I faced a moment of joy. It's the joy that you feel when knowledge turns into cognition. And there was much more to discover than just that moment.

More Than a Language (My Personal Way to F#)
---

There it was: My first attempt to really get a thing done in F# which simply wasn't possible in C# at all. I was searching for a way of doing digital signal processing. DSP in general requires "state", which is: "Accessible values from past evaluations". DSP chains are usually composed from smaller building blocks, where each block has it's own "local" state. Using C# and objects for this task felt extremely cumbersome: Objects have to be instanciated before they can be used; their evaluation must explicitly triggered, which was error-prone and destroyed the "easy-play-with-code" idea that I had in my mind. Now there were pure functions, which meant that there's only thing: Composition. One just has to put a function at the right place in a computation - and that's it. That sounded very compelling, and it was exactly what I aimed for. There was a problem, since pure functions are like: "There's no past; there's only present". How could I find a consens between these 2 concepts?

My mission was clear: Find a way that allows for composeing "state-aware" functions in a way that is as simple as if they were just pure functions. Years before, a friend of mine and me toured with a "Monads in C#"-speaking through user groups in Germany. It wasn't very successful, because they are not useful in C#. But I knew: Monads - as the queen of composition - was propably the way to go for this problem. My journey started learning F#, digging through the legendard "F# for Fun and Profit". I thought that I was a real good developer at that time, but I understood: There's still so much to learn, and knowing that made me happy.

I admired (and still do) the way Scott Wlaschin was able to teach, and I re-read his articles and book frequently. I took every turn I could take, revisiting things like state monad, which turned out to have a "global state" approach, but I needed a "local state" thing - so I moved on and discovered more and more, but no solution. So I wrapped my mind around the problem until that one "moment of joy". I still don't know if I discovered something new, but I didn't care, since I definitely found something that I lost for long: The joy of writing programs - and: It was clear to me that I wanted to get in touch with all the people I knew now from all my studies.


More than the sum of it's parts

The F# community is quite small, and that opens up many possibilities. There are so many ways to get yourself involved: Comment or write language suggestions, contribute to libraries, write your own stuff - that was all easy and low-barrier. 


You are not alone

Sometimes, people might feel like "abandoned" or like you're the only left-over of a past thing. That's not the case! Beleive me: There's a strong community, engaged people and you are not alone!

F# Applied challenge



...last but not least: There is Edgar, David, Florian and Jimmy. They built up Amplifying F# with their good spirit, their effort and 




"Met F# Londoners" - Isaac Abraham, 

Dawe, Edgar, Timothy Laviere... All trustful people. They are motivating and positive; they give the feeling of "You can do it; what you do is great", and it costed them: Nothing. I can easily say: These people are role models to me, ... Anstatt Verdacht zu wittern, lieber: Do what they do; be positive, open and motivating, tell them that they do great - because that's my honest opinion - and it will hopefully set energy free in thema, and also in me. And it costs me: Nothing, but gives me a smile, joy, and a lot of energy, too out of nothing. Sometimes, it's just so easy - and everyone can do that, too.

All that sounds like a happening of cool and positive people. And there's more: The people I met are one-of-a-kind highly skilled engineers, die mit ihren Fähigkeiten aus der Masse herausragen. Das mag vielieicht an Talent oder harter Arbeit liegen. Das bezweifle ich nicht. Doch bin ich überzeugt, dass man genau so weit kommen kann mit diesen beiden Fähigkeiten: Neugier und Spaß an der Sache. Ich sage es nochmal: Ich bin überzeugt, dass man damit genau so weit kommen kann. With F# as a language which automatically leads you on track towards these 2 properties.


Timo Mühlhaus, who spend their time to enable 

Jimmy Byrd - first impression was hig TNG background on a Zoom video session. Immediately sympathised. It was THE TV show of my youth - extremely underrated, weil sie Themen ansprach, die heutzutage so relevant sind wie kaum jemans zuvor. Now there are many reasons why to like TNG. Captain Picard. All the things described above... He's a person with human weaknesses - as we all are. But then, he's the strongest character, and he gets his strengeth out of being thoughtful, no easy decisions, taking initiative, being kind and respectful to others. Out of all this erwächst ein ehrliches, nicht zu erschütterndes Vertrauen derer, die ihn kennen.  ...und können sie in uns willkommen heißen.


It's meeting people - online or in-person - that matters.

F# didn't only give me back the joy of programming - the "play instinct", but much more. A feeling being connected to people who share similar feelings. Not only sharing similar interests - similar feelings. That's a difference. 

Of course I'm sometimes a little big "angry" that F# is not there where it could be from the aspect of popularity. Many are I guess. 


never "strong opinions". There were of course opinions, but they were intelligent, thoughtful and vermittelten niemals den Eindruck, unantastbar, unanzweifelbar oder unfehlbar zu sein. The communication was in my experience full of kindness, it was humorous and never bitter, open for other ideas and respectful even though one might have a different opinion. 

Tomas Pet, Krystof Cies, Isaac Abraham, and last but not least: Philipp Carter and Don Syme. 


I'm honestly happy for people who (...) have moved on; who found something new, etc. One can look at it with sadness; or happy if found place in "heart". It's trivial to read these words; for me propably took a long time to understand "turn sadness into happieness"; it means to me: Get things going, keep them rolling, and take initiative.
