## Problem

I frequently work with named fields in discriminated unions when I'm pattern matching.
An example use case:
<img alt="No intellisense when using named fields in discriminated unions" class="img-fluid" src="/images/sessions/namedPatternIntellisense.gif"/>

Notice I didn't have any proper autocomplete for the names inside my current discrimination union.
I had to look them up in the [documentation](https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-compiler-docs/reference/fsharp-compiler-syntax-synexpr.html#ObjExpr), which isn't the best editing experience.

## Expected behavior

It be nice if my editor gave me a list with all the named fields.
<small>
(In case of `SynExpr.ObjExpr` that would be `objType, argOptions, withKeyword, bindings, members, extraImpls, newExprRange, range`)
</small>

For this example, I used JetBrains Rider as my IDE, but I'm unsure if the issue is with Rider or the FSharp.Compiler.Service. This is the mystery we need to unravel. Let's dive in and investigate the problem. Our goal is to identify the root cause of the issue and make necessary improvements to enhance the IntelliSense functionality. To achieve this, we need to explore what's behind the IntelliSense feature and make informed decisions based on our findings.
