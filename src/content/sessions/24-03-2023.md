## Problem

Developers expect a large set of ready-to-use code-fixes and automatic refactoring features from their development environments.
FsAutoComplete offers already a big set but there are still a few essential ones missing.

## Expected behavior

All essential code-fixes and automatic refactoring features are offered by FsAutoComplete. We won't reach this goal in this session, but we'll make a little bit of progress.
