## Problem

- In the Ionide Solution Explorer you can move files around, however this currently requires a complete reload of the solution to see the changes. For larger repositories (like FAKE) this is a sluggish experience.

![Moving a file feel sluggish because of MSBuild reload](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1490044/222995329-cc86f4b9-2f5c-49df-b20d-6bbfaee49149.gif)

This issue should allow us to explore multiple projects in the toolchain:

- [ionide/proj-info](https://github.com/ionide/proj-info) - Parse and evaluate MsBuild project files
- [FsAutocomplete](https://github.com/fsharp/FsAutoComplete) - The F# language server using Language Server Protocol
- [ionide-vscode-fsharp](https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp) - VS Code plugin for F# development

## Expected behavior

We should find ways to make this seem snappier.  Ideas include:

- Using "evaluation" phase of MsBuild to get some properties without having to execute the whole msbuild engine
- Running the msbuild targets for the single project that has changed
