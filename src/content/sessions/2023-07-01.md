## Topic

The rough plan is:

- Meet at 14:00 in the [Papa Rhein Hotel](https://www.paparheinhotel.de/) in Bingen, Germany.
- Have 2-3 hours of Amplifying F# sessions, talks/presentations/showcases of any length, discussions etc. in some hotel conference room
- Go for a hike/walk to the castle Klopp and enjoy the beautiful view from up there
- Dinner and drinks at ~20:00 in an Italian restaurant
- It's the night of "Rhein in Flammen" so expect some fireworks ;)
