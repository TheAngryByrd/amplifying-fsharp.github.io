## Premise

Amplifying F# is not limited to virtual stream sessions only. We like to connect to developers in the physical world as well.
The F# developers over at the Norwegian Broadcast Company (NRK) are interested in contributing to open-source

## Topic

In recent months, the F# compiler has been enhanced with a new feature. By employing the `--test:GraphBasedChecking` flag, the compiler can now type-check your code (partially) in parallel. This capability has the potential to significantly reduce your project's overall compilation time, depending on its complexity.

In this session, we will delve into how to experiment with this feature using a prerelease version of the dotnet SDK. We'll examine the project file dependency graph and explore whether utilizing signature files could yield additional benefits.
