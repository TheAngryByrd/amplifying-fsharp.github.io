## Problem

Enhancements to generated XML Doc code-fixes

There are two things the command could be improved on:

- Don't add xml doc lines if there are already some doc lines present.
- Work on all possible AST elements, not just the ones for which we get a result from TryGetSignatureData.

```fsharp
testCaseAsync "documentation on member"
   <| CodeFix.check
     server
     """
     type MyClass() =
       n$0ew(x: int) = MyClass()
     """
     Diagnostics.acceptAll
     selectCodeFix
     """
     type MyClass() =
       /// <summary></summary>
       /// <param name="x"></param>
       /// <returns></returns>
       new(x: int) = MyClass()
     """
```

## Expected behavior
- Don't add xml doc lines if there are already some doc lines present.
