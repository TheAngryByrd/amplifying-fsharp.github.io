## Problem

[Fantomas tools](https://fsprojects.github.io/fantomas-tools/#/) is a collection of great utilities to use when working on [Fantomas](https://fsprojects.github.io/fantomas/) or the [F# untyped AST](https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-compiler-docs/reference/fsharp-compiler-syntax.html).  
The frontend using [Fable](https://fable.io/) &amp; [React](https://react.dev/) and the backend are a bunch of [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/f-tooling-support-for-aws-lambda/) functions.

These Lambda functions are an interesting way to keep the cost low, but they can take a while to start up.  
So, the advice from the maintainers is to run things locally to speed up the experience.

However, to this you need to install a bunch of dependencies, NodeJS among them, and it can be a bit of a pain to get everything working.

## Expected behavior

It would be nice if we could swap out the `Node.JS` bits and replace them with `Perla` to make the experience a bit more pleasant.  
[Perla](https://perla-docs.web.app/) is a modern development web server for front-end development written in `dotnet`.  
Because Perla is shipped as a `dotnet` tool, you only need to `dotnet` SDK to get started.
