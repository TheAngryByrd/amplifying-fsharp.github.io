        <p>
          F# is an programming language that runs on predominantly on `dotnet`.
          The larger F# ecosystem (compiler/tooling/frameworks) consists out of
          open-source software.<br />
          <br />
          When dealing <strong
            >open-source software it is important that it sustainable and
            future-proof</strong
          >. Otherwise, as an enterprise, you cannot justify choosing F# over an
          other language when there are no guarantees that the language will
          sustain the test of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important the <strong
            >F# ecosystem stays healthy can attract new companies</strong
          > that will use F# as in their production code.<br />
          When companies make money using F#, money can flow back into the F# ecosystem.<br
          />
          As it stand today, we believe a more <strong
            >targeted effort is required</strong
          > to achieve balance in this flow.
        </p>
        <h3 class="display-6 mt-4">The Messiah problem</h3>
        <p>
          F# is known to face a "Messiah problem". One individual or
          organisation is carrying the weight of a popular project. Said project
          has no sustainable funding and thus is completely at the mercy of the
          individual or company. This is not healthy and can lead to burn-out
          situations with the maintainers. Any popular project should not be
          abandoned when one individual or organisation does not have the
          bandwidth or energy to respond.
        </p>
        <p>
          More companies should get involved in popular projects and earn a seat
          at the table. The prosperity of an open-source should be influenced by
          the commercial user-base. It should be normalized that companies
          actually contribute back to their most-widely used projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no need in playing the waiting game for that matter. Don't
          wait until a project lost its sole maintainer to step up and take
          responsibility.
        </p>
        <h3 class="display-6 mt-4">Giving back</h3>
        <p>
          To make a substantial difference in project (be it solving a bug or
          adding a feature) actual code needs to be written. Being able to code,
          the skill every software developer possesses, is the one thing we are
          after in our endeavour. We need people that use F# for developing
          commercial software, to do some of that coding on open-source
          projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why people in the enterprise landscape? Because they can reliably
          contribute during working hours. That is the effort we are seeking
          companies to do. Let your brilliant engineers work on the tooling they
          use on a daily basis. Let us sharpen the saw and everybody more
          productive in F#.
        </p>
        <p>
          By all means, we do not wish to excluded any other F# enthusiasts, but
          our main focus group are developers code F# for a living. Companies
          should give back to the open-source language that is making them
          money. They can easily do that by granting some time to contribute to
          F# open-source.

        <h2 class="display-4">Who are we?</h2>
        <p>
          We are a group of independent individuals, not tied to any
          organisation with an ambition to see `F#` grow. What brought us
          together our aspiration to make an actual difference in the F#
          open-source landscape. United we can take this F# ecosystem to the
          next level. By hand-ons collaboration and targeted efforts.

        <h3 class="display-6 mt-4">Enter the hive</h3>
        <p>
          The world of open-source software can be quite overwhelming to get
          your feet in wet. There is a lot to learn and you might not be
          confident that you can contribute actually code changes. A just like
          starting a new job, you need to learn a new codebase. An open-source
          project is no different. You can read more about this experience is
          [Edgar's testimonial](#). And that is why we want to invoke our
          collective hive-mind to help people get started. We want to guide you
          as best as we can to scratch your own itch in the open-source space.

        <h2 class="display-4">What to contribute?</h2>
        <p>
          Literally anything (within reason ðŸ˜¸) you want to see improved in your
          daily F# experience. Be it a compiler feature, tooling improvement,
          performance increase, ... There is so much work left to do in the F#
          eco-system and there for sure is something we can do that will rock
          your boat.

        <h2 class="display-4">Convincing your boss?</h2>
        <p>
          In practical terms, you should see this initiative as two things:
          educational and an attempt to improve daily productivity. There is a
          lot you can learn from pair/mob programming with seasoned F# developer
          all over the world. The diversity of backgrounds can broaden your
          perspective and genuinely make you better at your job. Being able to
          solve outstanding problems that hinder your day-to-day flow, will
          reward itself over time. If you need more help to convince your boss,
          you can refer to our [incitation letter](#) or we reach [out to
          us](#email) and we would happily chime in.
